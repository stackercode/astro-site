# My first blog post

Published on: 12-01-2022

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new **_Astro project_** and setup my online accounts.
1. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new **`.astro`** files and placing them in the **`src/pages`** folder.
1. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have **_Astro_** pages and **_Markdown_** posts.

## What is next?

I will finish the **_Astro_** tutorial and keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
